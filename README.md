# Machine-Learning-for-Rice-Nutritional-Components

The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) boasts an extensive collection of pigmented rice varieties rich in valuable metabolites. 
By subjecting a diverse array of pigmented rice to germination, we aim to enhance the nutritional qualities of rice further.
This endeavor involves a focused and systematic approach to characterizing these rice collections, which will enable us to unravel the multi-nutritional properties of pigmented rice. 
The project revolves around leveraging machine learning techniques to classify rice samples based on their vitamin, mineral, and metabolite content.
The ultimate goal is to develop a robust model capable of accurately classifying pigmented rice sprouts, a valuable tool in breeding rice varieties with superior nutritional properties. 
Additionally, this model will help identify important donor lines harboring enhanced dietary attributes.
Through this comprehensive research, we envision significant advancements in creating rice varieties that offer not only improved nutritional benefits but also contribute to enhancing global food security and human health.
